# Firefox-voice-extension
Extension to control firefox via voice commands. Takes voice commands from [Project Voice Engine](https://github.com/Abhishek8394/VoiceEngine) by interfacing with 
[vop-interface-server](https://github.com/Abhishek8394/vop-interface-server).
## Status
This is a proof of concept at the moment. Major changes to be done once the backend is ready.
